There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
 WINEFLIX

## Sub-Heading ##
  For wine-drinking millennials who want a fun twist on movie night.

## Summary ##
 Wineflix intelligently recommends pairings of movies and wine. Pairing a wine with traits that correspond to the content of a film adds a fun, full-sensory experience to a popular pastime, and encourages the user to broaden their horizons as both a wine drinker and a moviegoer.

## Problem ##
  "What kind of wine could I drink to enhance my experience of this movie?"
  or:
  "What kind of movie would be best experienced with this bottle of wine?"

## Solution ##
   Wineflix runs wine and film data entries through a neural network and intelligently matches them using our proprietary algorithm. All users need to do is enter the name of a movie or wine, and Wineflix will recommend an appropriate pair. Users can view a log of past movie/wine pairings, and even rate or comment on their experience.

## Quote from You ##
  "Movies are great. Wine is great. Put them together and you get something double great. Or is that great squared? Wineflix."

## How to Get Started ##
  Getting started is easier than an ID check! Just use our app on your [PC/PHONE/TBA] and in seconds you'll have a perfect pairing of a sip and a flick.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I appreciate a good wine, but I'm less versed on the subject than I am on, say, the works of award-winning actor and national treasure Leonardo DiCaprio. So when I found out about Wineflix in time for my semiannual DiCapri-Opus Film Marathon, I thought I'd try it out. From a romantic Cab Sauvignon for Titanic to a chilly ice wine for The Revenant, the pairings were so good, it left me scratching my head why they didn't win an Oscar. Oh wait, I can't make that joke anymore."
  -Anonymous, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences
